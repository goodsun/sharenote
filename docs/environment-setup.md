# Environment Setup Guide

*Alexa Voice Memo - Environment Management Strategy*

## 🎯 Environment Philosophy

Following **ideanotes スモールスタート原則**:
- **Start Simple**: Single `dev` environment for initial development
- **Scale When Needed**: Add `staging`/`prod` when business demands it
- **Cost Conscious**: Minimize AWS resources until required
- **Development First**: Optimize for development speed and learning

## 📋 Current Environment Status

### Phase 1: Development Only (Current)
```
✅ dev environment
   ├── 🏗️ AWS Infrastructure: showin-dev-*
   ├── 🔧 Configuration: .env.dev
   ├── 🎤 Alexa Testing: Real Echo device
   ├── 🌿 Git Branch: develop
   └── 💰 Monthly Cost: ~$0.03

❌ staging environment (Not needed yet)
❌ production environment (Not needed yet)
```

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# Current .env.dev
CDK_ACCOUNT=498997347996
CDK_REGION=ap-northeast-1
CDK_ENV=dev

# Web UI環境変数 (.env.dev, .env.stg, .env.prod)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID_DEV=940084652550-h58mte04laqb402kfv43ts39tu0n7cgt.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID_STG=your-staging-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID_PROD=your-production-client-id

# Lambda環境変数（CDKで自動設定）
MEMO_TABLE_NAME=showin-${CDK_ENV}-memos
USER_TABLE_NAME=showin-${CDK_ENV}-users
INVITE_CODE_TABLE_NAME=showin-${CDK_ENV}-invite-codes
```

### Alexa Skills Configuration
```
📱 Amazon Developer Console Skills:

Current (Phase 1):
├── "Voice Memo" (dev skill)
│   ├── Endpoint: showin-dev-handler
│   ├── Skill ID: amzn1.ask.skill.xxx-dev
│   ├── 🏠 Personal Echo device testing
│   └── Command: "アレクサ、ボイスメモを開いて"

Future (Phase 2 - Staging):
├── "Voice Memo Dev" (renamed for clarity)
├── "Voice Memo Staging" (new staging skill)
│   ├── Endpoint: showin-stg-handler
│   ├── Skill ID: amzn1.ask.skill.xxx-stg
│   ├── 🧪 UAT/stakeholder testing
│   └── Command: "アレクサ、ボイスメモ検証版を開いて"

Future (Phase 3 - Production):
└── "Voice Memo" (public production skill)
    ├── Endpoint: showin-prod-handler
    ├── Skill ID: amzn1.ask.skill.xxx-prod
    ├── 🌍 Alexa Skills Store public release
    └── Command: "アレクサ、ボイスメモを開いて"
```

**Single Device Testing Strategy:**
- One Echo device can test multiple skills
- Different invocation names distinguish environments
- Dev/staging skills remain private (testing only)
- Production skill becomes publicly available

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline Status

### Current Setup
```yaml
Branches → Environments:
├── develop branch → showin-dev (✅ Active)
├── staging branch → showin-stg (⏸️ Prepared)
└── production branch → showin-prod (⏸️ Prepared)
```

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- ✅ **Automated Testing**: All pushes trigger tests
- ✅ **Development Deployment**: `develop` branch → auto deploy to dev
- ⏸️ **Staging Deployment**: Ready but not needed yet
- ⏸️ **Production Deployment**: Ready but not needed yet

### Google OAuth Setup
```
Google Cloud Console:
1. APIs & Services > Credentials
2. Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID
3. Application type: Web application
4. Authorized JavaScript origins:
   - Dev: http://localhost:8080
   - Dev: http://showin-dev-frontend.s3-website-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com
   - Staging: http://showin-stg-frontend.s3-website-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com
   - Prod: https://your-custom-domain.com
5. Copy Client ID to appropriate .env file
```

## 📊 When to Scale Environments

### Triggers for Adding Staging Environment
- [ ] Multiple developers working simultaneously
- [ ] Complex features requiring pre-production testing
- [ ] Need for user acceptance testing (UAT)
- [ ] Monthly active users > 50
- [ ] Business stakeholder review requirements

### Triggers for Adding Production Environment
- [ ] Public release to Alexa Skills Store
- [ ] SLA requirements (uptime guarantees)
- [ ] Compliance requirements (data separation)
- [ ] Monthly active users > 500
- [ ] Revenue generation from service

## 🛠️ Environment Expansion Checklist

## 💡 Cost Management

### Current Costs (Dev Only)
```
DynamoDB On-Demand: ~$0.01/month

CloudWatch Logs: ~$0.01/month
Total: ~$0.03/month
```

### Projected Costs (All Environments)
```
Dev Environment: ~$0.03/month
Staging Environment: ~$0.05/month
Production Environment: ~$0.20/month (with monitoring)
Total: ~$0.28/month
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Current Security (Dev)
